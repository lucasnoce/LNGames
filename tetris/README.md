# Tetris

My (simpler) version of the classic game. Inspired by Javier LÃ³pez ideas, but changing pretty much everything from their guide. Still a lot left to make it playable though.

To do list:
- Easy part:
  - Periodically move the new piece down
  - "Fix" the piece on its last state
  - Add keyboard inputs
  - Score when full row
- Further development:
  - Add proper graphics
