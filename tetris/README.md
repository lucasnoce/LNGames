# Tetris

My (simpler) version of the classic game. Inspired by Javier LÃ³pez ideas, but changing pretty much everything from their guide. Still a lot left to make it playable though.

To do list:
- Easy part:
  - ~[Done] Periodically move the new piece down~
  - ~[Done] "Fix" the piece on its last state~
  - ~[Done] Add keyboard inputs~
  - ~[Done] Score when full row~
  - Add difficulty levels
  - Add menu
  - Each piece with a different color
- Further development:
  - Add proper graphics, with SDL or SFML for example
